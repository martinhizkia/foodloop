# FoodLoop Mobile Application

## 1. What is FoodLoop?

FoodLoop is an Android-based application to enable people to share food people around in need. User can upload the edible and proper food via FoodLoop and people around can see it. We hope with this application, people can access and get edible and proper at reasonable or even free price.

## 3. Implementation

### Android

These following libraries or dependencies were used to create the FoodLoop Application (android):

1. Lottie Library to create splash screen animation.
2. Denzcoskun Library to create animated display image slide contained in Home Page
3. RxJava to create the registration page/activity.
4. Retrofit Library to POST, GET, and DELETE via REST API.
5. Firebase SDK to upload image to the Google Cloud Storage (Bucket)

### Cloud

FoodLoop is using Google Cloud Platform (GCP) for its Backend and Infrastructure

1. Google Cloud Run, to run, deploy, and expose the web service, which had been created before using ExpressJS and containerized using Docker.
2. Google Cloud SQL, to create Database for storing the User Information and Food Informastion.
3. Google Image Registry, to store and save the Docker Image which had been created before to the cloud.
4. Google Storage (Bucket), to store Food Image in the Cloud.

### Machine Learning

Foodloop are using the Inception-v3 model and use all the layers in the model except for the last fully connected layer.
